# Daikin P1/P2 Raspberry Pi hat

This project is about a Raspberry Pi hat/standalone interface to communicate
over the proprietary Daikin P1/P2 power-line bus.

Instead of a [MAX22088](https://www.analog.com/en/products/max22088.html)
it uses a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)
and [LM4871](https://www.ti.com/product/LM4871) audio amplifier as modem.

For more details on P1/P2 bus check out
[https://github.com/Arnold-n/P1P2Serial](https://github.com/Arnold-n/P1P2Serial).

It features:
- Galvanic isolation
- 115200baud ASCII [UART interface](pico/doc/uart.md)
- [3 Status LEDs](pico/doc/leds.md)
- Autonomous mode to emulate "External controller" on address F0h
- Bus idle/busy detection
- Collision detection on TX
- Easy to solder: [no QFN parts, only SOIC-8](kicad/doc/circuits.md)
- Cost around 20â‚¬ (PCB + parts)
- Raspberry Pi hat compatible (powered from +5V)
- Micro-USB for standalone mode (powered over USB)

The board can be powered over Micro-USB only and doesn't need a Raspberry Pi
baseboard. The communication then will be done over the virtual USB UART.

    This project is not an offical Daikin product. Use own your own risk!
    It has been tested on a Daikin EJHA04AAV3.

## The hardware

There are 3 connectors on the Pi hat:
1. Rasperry Pi 40-pin header
  - Provides power
  - Connects to the UART on GPIO14/GPIO15
  - Connects CTS/RTS on GPIO16/GPIO17
  - Signals a bus collision on GPIO22
2. P1/P2 bus connector
 - P1
 - P2
 - Earth
3. Micro USB
 - Allows to update the Pico firmware
 - Powers the board when used in standalone mode

A. Reset button
B. Boot-mode button
   Hold button B and press button A to enter the
   Raspberry Pico USB bootloader.
